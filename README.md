# Pipeless

Why move items around with pipes if they want to move themselves around?

Just craft an **attractive chest** with a chest and a golden apple and hold it in your hand. Nearby items will eagerly pathfind towards you.

Items aren't just attracted to players holding attractive chests, other mobs work too, including armor stands - good for automation! Oddly, armor stands grow arms when you click on them with an attractive chest (I guess holding them must be attractive too?) which gives you a way to allow armor stands to hold stuff without using commands.
